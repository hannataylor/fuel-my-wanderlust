# Fuel My Wanderlust

A "mock" travel inspiration website, utilizing Booking.com's Affiliate Partner products.

Built using Jekyll, a static site generator in Ruby, using Bootstrap for the CSS Framework.

No themes were used, and all photos were taken by me during my travels.

I built this site as a quick evening project to use a domain name I had sitting around, and to play around with HTML and CSS, and Booking.com's Affliate Partner products.
